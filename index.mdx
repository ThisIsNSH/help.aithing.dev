## `@this` is unique

AI Thing is uniquely capable of understanding `@this`—a way to refer to the environment it's currently running in. 

<Tip>AI Thing can "see" *(with permission)* what you're working on *(like a spreadsheet, document, or browser tab)* and take action without requiring you to copy and paste anything manually.</Tip>

For example, you can say:
> *Email all the people in `@this` sheet. Once the email is sent, mark the rows green and set a reminder to review this sheet with the team tomorrow.*

Complex? Yes. But with AI Thing, it just works.
Forget repetitive busywork. Just ask—and get back to what matters.

## Abstraction & Privacy

<Note>AI Thing is privacy-first. It doesn’t capture continuously—only when you explicitly use `@this`. We chose to do it differently.</Note>
