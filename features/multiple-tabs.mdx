  Just like browser tabs, you can open multiple tabs in AI Thing—each running a different task, with separate memory and agents working in parallel.

## Built for Multi-Tasking

You might be debug code in one tab, researching in another, and summarizing a document in a third—all at once. Each tab is completely isolated, with its own:

- Context and memory  
- Active AI agents  
- Screen snapshot (if using `@this`)  
- Ongoing conversations  

This means you can switch between tasks without losing track of what you're doing.

## How to Use Tabs

| Shortcut | Action              |
|----------|---------------------|
| `Control (⌃) + N` | Open a new tab        |
| `Control (⌃) + W` | Close current tab     |
| `Control (⌃) + >` | Move to next tab      |
| `Control (⌃) + <` | Move to previous tab  |

<Note>
  Each tab consumes its own set of resources—close unused ones to save memory and agent capacity.
