  Just like browser tabs, you can open multiple tabs in AI Thing—each running a different task, with separate memory and agents working in parallel.

## Built for Multi-Tasking

You might be debug code in one tab, researching in another, and summarizing a document in a third—all at once. Each tab is completely isolated, with its own:

- Context and memory  
- Active AI agents  
- Screen snapshot (if using `@this`)  
- Ongoing conversations  

This means you can switch between tasks without losing track of what you're doing.

## How to Use Tabs

| Shortcut | Action              |
|----------|---------------------|
| `⌃ (Control) + N` | Open a new tab        |
| `⌃ (Control) + W` | Close current tab     |
| `⌃ (Control) + > (Right Angular Bracket)`        | Switch to the next tab |
| `⌃ (Control) + < (Left Angular Bracket)`        | Switch to the previous tab |

<Note>
  Each tab consumes its own set of resources—close unused ones to save memory and agent capacity.
