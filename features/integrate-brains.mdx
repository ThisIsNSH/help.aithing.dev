## Self Managed API Key

Use your own API key to connect directly to Anthropic's Claude models.

1. Get an API key from [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api)
2. Paste the key into the field that starts with `sk-ant-...`
3. Enable the toggle to activate the model

This option gives you full ownership and flexibility, with no plan required.

<Info>Only Claude Sonnet 4 is supported for now in self-managed mode.</Info>

- Anthropic: Claude Sonnet 4

No need to manage API keys. Just enable the model with a single click in the settings panel.

## Managed by Oraganization 

For enterprise users, organizations can host their own models—customized and fine-tuned for internal knowledge and use cases.

Admins can:

- Create and configure organization-wide brains
- Preload relevant data and policies
- Make them available for team members securely

<Tip>Upgrade to the [Enterprise Plan](/plans#enterprise) to distribute custom models to internal users.</Tip>
