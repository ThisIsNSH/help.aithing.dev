<Card title=" " img="/images/manage-agents.png">
  Agents are powerful helpers that perform specific tasks like building apps, working with GitHub, or integrating with custom tools. You can manage agents easily with global or local setups.

Just like Brains, agents can be configured in three ways:

## Self Managed

Add your own agents manually using either **Global** or **Local** mode.

<Card title="Global Mode" img="/images/manage-agents-global.png">
  Use this when your agent is already hosted online (e.g. APIs, remote services).

  **Example:**

  ```json
  
    "Name": "GitHub",
    "URL": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
    "Auth Token": "ghp_testing"
  
  ````

  <Info>The Auth Token is optional. It is used to authenticate your access.</Info>
</Card>

<Card title="Local Mode" img="/images/manage-agents-local.png">
  Use this when the agent runs locally on your own machine (e.g. through Docker, CLI tools, wrappers).

  **Example:**

  ```json
  
    "Name": "XCode",
    "Command": "/usr/local/bin/xcode-npx-wrapper"
    "Arguments": "-y xcodebuildmcp@latest"
  
  ```
  
  <Info>Arguments are optional. These are space-separated values passed to the command.</Info>
</Card>

To add a new agent:

1. Click **+ Add Agent**
2. Enter the name, and choose between **Global** or **Local**
3. Fill in the required fields based on the mode
4. Toggle the agent ON to activate

<Info>You can add up to 3 agents with the Free Plan.</Info>

<Note>Upgrade to the [Individual Plan](/plans#individual) to unlock managed agents.</Note>

## Managed by Organization

Enterprise users can centrally configure and deploy agents for their teams. Perfect for shared workflows and sensitive integrations.

Admins can:

* Add and distribute internal agents
* Control access securely
* Fine-tune them for company-specific workflows

<Tip>Upgrade to the [Enterprise Plan](/plans#enterprise) to distribute internal agents.</Tip>
